# birch-record-crate
Making (somewhat) repeatable record crates.

# Backgound

My records are largely housed in the ubiquitous Ikea Kallax which you can mix and match from 1×1 up to a 5×5. I am a decent filer, but I do have a cache of recently purchased records which have been accumulating in front of the hifi and I think they need a home.

# Construction

I decided to try to use pocket holes as my joinery method. I used the Kreg calculator. I needed the 1″ coarse thread for plywood.

I started with a 4×8 sheet of plywood and began trimming it down. If I had a panel system, this might be easier. Once all the pieces were cut, it was time to use my Kreg work station. It was very quick since the 720 jig has a spring clamp that is fast to set and reset. The sides and the end overlap the bottom, so the bottom is the piece with many holes. I used a bead of glue because…I guess I am old school. Assembly was quick, particularly since I wasn’t restricted by the number of clamps waiting for glue to set up.

I used my Bessey corner clamp to get these started and then drove the Kreg screws.

I completed the first one, then went back and mimicked the first patterns. Of course it was faster. One optimization was to use my spring clamps on the end caps and drill the holes at the same time. Each hole was really two cuts, so each hole required removing the holes saw, extracting the starting bit, removing the cut pieces, reassembling the starting bit, and remounting the hole saw in the drill press.

# Project Impressions

* The Kreg 720 jig can fool you into going too fast.  It's easy to clamp and align.  You still need to take your time drilling out the pocket hole so that each is really clean and really the same depth.  If they aren't the same depth, your pocket screws will have different depths too which means differing depths of exposed metal screws.
* Home Depot does not sell the Kreg screws in the screw aisle.  They are in the power tools section near the drills.
* I think the height of the crate is spot on.  It accommodates and protects oversized box sets and Laserdics easily.
* Although the size is appealing, I didn't consider the loaded weight of the crate when full.  They are quite heavy and so the idea of moving them around easily is more like a question of how do I avoid a hernia.
* Pocket hole screws and high torque drivers don't match well.  Going slow would pay off.
